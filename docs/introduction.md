# Introduction  

Study Buddy AI is an **adaptive tutoring agent** that enhances learning by combining intelligent chat-based explanations with progress tracking.  

Unlike traditional chatbots, this system is designed to act as a tutor. It not only explains concepts but also evaluates user responses, generates quizzes, and suggests personalized next steps.  

Key Goals:  
- Deliver structured explanations for better understanding.  
- Provide real-world examples to strengthen knowledge.  
- Track accuracy and performance for adaptive feedback.  
- Support multiple AI model backends (Gemini API, Ollama).
